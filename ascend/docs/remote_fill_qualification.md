# Direct Remote LMCache qualification

This runbook applies the production-path qualification plan. It does not claim
that native direct placement has passed C1 or production qualification.
The production default remains disabled, and the conservative wire protocol is
unchanged.

## Minimal feature configuration

RemoteFill now derives its cache namespace, serving-bundle fingerprint,
two-group control-page bound, decoder bind address/port, advertised decoder
host, borrowed GlobalTE mode, and prefiller-local persistence placement. The
only new LMCache setting required on P and D is:

```yaml
enable_remote_lmcache_store: true
```

`remote_fill_submission_mode` defaults to `per_chunk`; set it to
`final_deferred` for the conservative rollback path.

In `per_chunk` mode, full pages and a partial tail from the same final store
call may share one RemoteFill producer job. This is selected only when exactly
one job slot remains and the combined payload fits the current request/global
byte headroom. Otherwise full pages keep their earlier submission, preserving
overlap with tail preparation. The decision is a hint; actual admission still
rechecks live limits. It avoids needing three slots for a prefix probe, full
pages, and a small tail in the eligible case. Earlier chunks still stream
normally; persistent full-page and tail puts remain separate. Source owners and
all producer fences are retained, and native windows keep their existing bounds.
No configuration change is required. Byte pressure, prefix holes and other
outstanding jobs can still cause the normal persistent fallback.

Use the standalone connector on both P and D:

```json
{
  "kv_connector": "LMCacheAscendConnectorV1Dynamic",
  "kv_role": "kv_both",
  "kv_load_failure_policy": "recompute",
  "kv_connector_module_path":
    "lmcache_ascend.integration.vllm.lmcache_ascend_connector_v1"
}
```

Do not add a sibling `MooncakeConnectorV1`. Mandatory persistence and shared
GlobalTE reuse are owned by LMCache's Mooncake backend in this design.

The feature flag internally selects DSA two-group page layout, rank0 ownership,
strict shared publication on D, per-chunk asynchronous direct storage on P,
final-only publication, and non-evicting reservations. The deployment still needs its
ordinary Mooncake URL, P/D role, decoder LocalCPU capacity, and already working
cold-compact model settings. An operator may
still override `remote_fill_model_artifact_id` with an immutable build ID when
its artifact store can replace unsampled weight contents in place, and may
override `remote_fill_cache_namespace` for deliberate isolation. Decoder
control address/port overrides are needed only when the GlobalTE-advertised
host or port range beginning at 19000 is unsuitable.

D generates one random 32-byte descriptor-verification capability when its
RemoteFill runtime starts. The decoder placement response carries it only to
the trusted proxy, which forwards it only to the selected P and removes it
before decoder dispatch or API egress. A decoder restart rotates the value, so
stale placement cannot verify newly issued destination descriptors. No secret
file or environment variable is required. This assumes the proxy and private
control network are trusted; it is not protection against an active network
attacker.

## Freeze one exact run

Copy `benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_inventory.example.json`, replace
every placeholder with observed deployment data, and generate the manifest:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_qualification.py \
  inventory.json qualification-manifest.json
```

The command rejects a dirty repository, a missing artifact identity, invalid
topology values, or an incomplete clock/network inventory. For an explicitly
nonqualifying development snapshot, `--allow-dirty` records the dirty state.

Maintain V1--V8 evidence in a copy of
`remote_fill_evidence.example.json`. Bind it to the exact manifest with:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_qualification.py \
  inventory.json qualification-record.json --evidence evidence.json
```

Every raw evidence file must contain a JSON/JSONL
`qualification_evidence_identity` record carrying the same producing host,
clock domain, trial ID, manifest SHA-256, adapter-module SHA-256, and command as
its evidence record. Validation hashes both the artifact and adapter and rejects
an external record whose binding header is absent or different.

Add `--require-hardware` only for a C1-exit or release record. It rejects every
remaining `PENDING_HARDWARE` item and requires V1, V2, and V6 to carry
`FIXED_AND_PASS` hardware evidence; unit-only evidence cannot close those gates.

## Optional H0 transport diagnostic

H0 must run in an isolated P/D deployment with the exact production GlobalTE,
source registration, source-page planner, decoder LocalCPU allocator, NIC,
MTU, routing, and NUMA policy. It is an optional transport-development
diagnostic, not a runtime activation gate or a release blocker.

The hardware driver must cover H0-A through H0-G from the governing plan and
retain raw results. It must validate destination bytes inside D before any test
allocation is released and must not publish synthetic pages into ordinary
LMCache. Stop the campaign on a byte/canary mismatch, late mutation, ambiguous
native terminal state, registration overlap, or resource leak. Validate the
resulting report with `validate_h0_report`; its
`qualification_manifest_sha256` must equal `payload_sha256` of the exact
generated manifest.

`remote_fill_h0.py` owns the fixed case order, partial-token matrix, manifest
binding, fail-closed validation, and cleanup. Supply a deployment adapter as a
`module:factory`; that adapter is intentionally kept beside the real launcher
because it must reach the live P/D GlobalTE sessions and D-local hidden bytes:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_h0.py \
  --adapter production_h0:create_adapter --adapter-config h0-config.json \
  --manifest qualification-manifest.json --output h0-report.json \
  --chunk-size 256 --window-tokens 4096 --soak-iterations 100
```

The adapter contract is `H0Adapter`. A mock adapter can test orchestration but
cannot satisfy a hardware evidence record; its report must never be promoted
to `FIXED_AND_PASS` or treated as production-path evidence.

## Client-observed TTFT

Prepare JSONL prompts with exactly `case_id`, `prompt`, and the tokenizer-
verified `expected_prompt_tokens`, then run each clean A/B/C deployment
separately:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_workload.py \
  --endpoint http://proxy:9000/v1/completions \
  --mode C --trial-id c-128k-01 --workload-id cold-128k-v1 \
  --qualification-manifest qualification-manifest.json --cache-state cold \
  --prompts prompts.jsonl --output c-128k-01.jsonl \
  --repetitions 10 --warmups 0 --concurrency 1 --max-tokens 1
```

The runner finishes every warmup before admitting measured work and binds each
row to the canonical workload plus exact qualification manifest. The client
parses SSE until the first nonempty completion text/chat delta and records it
as TTFT; first HTTP byte remains a separate TTFB metric. The proxy returns its
internal request identity in `X-Request-Id`; missing identities or stream-level
errors fail the trial. Streaming usage is required and a prompt-token mismatch
fails the trial. Each row records `run_id`, `batch_id`, and `repetition_id`; TTFT
confidence bounds resample independent repetition batches rather than
correlated concurrent requests. Cold-performance events now carry
host, wall time, and a boot-scoped clock domain. Use monotonic differences only
within one clock domain and use the manifest's measured PTP/NTP offset for
cross-host ordering. Never subtract P monotonic time from D monotonic time.

Content diagnostics and device readback must be disabled for P1. Use fresh
cache namespaces or an audited complete cache reset for every cold repetition.
Do not mix warmups, first misses, and later prefix hits in one distribution.
After all three runs, compare only pairwise-identical trials:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_compare.py \
  --mode-a a.jsonl --mode-b b.jsonl --mode-c c.jsonl \
  --output abc-comparison.json
```

The comparison reports the disabled-path TTFT gate and the client-TTFT portion
of the experimental gate. It deliberately leaves `proceed_gate_complete=false`
until decoder critical-path reduction and active-load interference evidence are
joined from stage traces.

Use two measurement passes. The attribution pass may enable cold-performance
per-window events at concurrency 1 for selected requests. The definitive TTFT
pass must disable per-window cold-performance logging, NPU content diagnostics,
exact-key traces, and profilers; retain only bounded aggregate metrics and the
client first-generated-token record. Do not use an instrumented TTFT sample as
the definitive A/B/C result.

Build a request-local stage trace without cross-host monotonic subtraction:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_trace.py --trace REQUEST_UUID \
  --log proxy=proxy.log --log prefiller=P.log --log decoder=D.log \
  --client c-128k-01.jsonl --output c-128k-01-trace.json
```

Per-window and commit timings are explanatory children of the prefiller round
trip. The trace labels them explicitly so they are not added to TTFT twice.
Source-event fence wait and GlobalTE source-registration time are measured
separately. The last required producer-fence-ready timestamp is the
authoritative KV-production frontier for overlap/tail analysis. TP0 model
forward timing remains a CPU submission metric and is not treated as NPU
completion.

Before declaring C1 complete, fill
`remote_fill_c1.example.json`, or run the fixed production-topology adapter:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_c1.py \
  --adapter production_c1:create_adapter --adapter-config c1-config.json \
  --manifest qualification-manifest.json --output c1-report.json
```

The adapter must run beside the real TP8/DP2/MTP launcher. The runner fixes the
nine-scenario order, binds the report to the manifest, always closes the
adapter, and requires explicit use of production vLLM, standalone
`LMCacheAscendConnectorV1Dynamic`, LMCache, Mooncake, shared LocalCPU, DP2
routing, and MTP. A mock validates only
orchestration. `validate_c1_report` requires scenario-specific proof, both TP8
passive-group failure campaigns, all four DP2 mappings, bounded diagnostics,
the complete comparison matrix, a cross-DP reuse decision, and zero values for
every integrity invariant. Fill
`remote_fill_p1.example.json` and feed the final P1 aggregate to
`evaluate_p1_report`; it applies the documented disabled/fallback,
experimental, production, publication, overlap, and O1 thresholds. It always
keeps O2 disabled until a separate post-O1 hardware result exists.

The shipped P1 runner currently supports exactly A/B/C. Provide a deployment
adapter that activates each mode and completely resets cache state before it.
Every result must attest its path contract: A=`existing_production_path`,
B=`new_code_feature_disabled`, and C=`conservative_remote_fill`. This prevents
a partially enabled mode from being accepted as a valid comparison. Cold
evidence must also attest either a full tier clear before every measured batch
or a unique cache namespace for every measured batch; resetting only once per
mode is not a cold campaign:

```bash
python benchmark/v1/kv_transfer/remote_fill_campaign.py \
  --adapter production_p1:create_adapter --adapter-config p1-config.json \
  --manifest qualification-manifest.json --output p1-campaign.json \
  --max-supported-tokens 131072 --tier 1
```

The campaign alternates A/B/C order, requires identical workload identity,
separate warmups, at least ten measured repetitions, per-batch cold-cache
isolation, disabled content diagnostics, and raw evidence for every run. It
covers the documented Tier 1--4 progression without introducing a full
Cartesian product. Tier 1 is
the default; run `--tier 2`, then `--tier 3`, and finally targeted `--tier 4`
only after reviewing the preceding report. Multiple `--tier` options may be
combined deliberately.

Before Phase 8, extend the workload, comparator, campaign, and strict
qualification validator with D=`asynchronous_remote_fill`. Until that extension
lands, the command above cannot qualify per-chunk overlap or an A/B/C/D result.

## Paired restart boundary

Before hardware fault injection, the deployment supervisor must treat the
selected source engine and destination engine—including all TP/DP workers—as
one restart unit. On unresolved ARM/REPORT recovery, native hard timeout,
worker crash during DMA, TransferEngine reset, or registered-pool loss:

1. remove the P/D pair from proxy placement;
2. stop admission to both engines;
3. terminate both complete process groups;
4. wait for every process to exit before memory can be reused;
5. start both engines with new engine epochs, sessions, registrations, and
   shared-cache generation;
6. rediscover placement before restoring traffic.

Dying only D, restarting one TP worker, or reusing an old capability is unsafe.
Until the supervisor automates this sequence, fault injection and production
fault qualification remain prohibited; fault-free H0/C1 runs may use the same
sequence manually after stopping the run.

`vllm_ascend.distributed.kv_transfer.remote_fill_restart` provides the narrow
`PairedRestartAdapter` and `restart_affected_pair()` state machine. A deployment
adapter must bind those calls to the real proxy and process supervisor. The
state machine never republishes placement or restores admission unless every P
and D process stopped and source/destination epochs, sessions, and shared-cache
generation all changed. Merely importing this module is not deployment
automation; fault qualification remains prohibited until the production
supervisor adapter is exercised and its restart record retained.

```bash
python -m vllm_ascend.distributed.kv_transfer.remote_fill_restart \
  --adapter production_supervisor:create_adapter \
  --adapter-config supervisor.json --pair-id p0-d1 \
  --timeout-seconds 300 --output paired-restart.json
```

## Optimization decision

Do not implement lookahead, `ADVANCE`, or two simultaneous native writes from
this runbook. First retain the clean current-protocol P1 result. One unarmed
lookahead becomes eligible only when its measured native gap and post-prefill
tail cross the thresholds in the governing plan. `ADVANCE` is considered only
after lookahead leaves REPORT+ARM as a material TTFT contributor.
